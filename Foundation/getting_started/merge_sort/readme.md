2.3 : merge sort

     1) mergeCode.py -> has the code for merge sort 

             in the book , merge is out-of-place meaning it needs an additional memory equals to the input size.
             however , my code will be in-place plus the main call of merge_sort(p, r, A=[] ) should have zero as its p // len(input)-1 as its r


      2) files that start with 2.X -> the problems at the end of this section

            2.1 insertion X merge 
                multithreaded programm that uses both algos
